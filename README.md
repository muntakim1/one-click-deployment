# One-click-deployment

This is my demo project for one-click docker image builder. That docker image can be used in Kubernetes. 


## Backend 🙏

The Backend is written in [Golang](https://golang.org/). This is my third project using Golang.😎😎😎


## Frontend 🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️

The frontend is written in [ReactJS](http://reactjs.org/). React is a popular library for creating frontend. I used it as it requires less code to write.😂😂😂


### Usage 👀👀👀

```
git clone https://github.com/muntakim1/one-click-deployment.git

cd ./one-click-deployment

go mod tidy 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

go main.go 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️

```
