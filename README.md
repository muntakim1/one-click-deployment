# One-click-deployment

This is my demo project for one-click docker image builder. That docker image can be used in Kubernetes. 


## Backend

The Backend is written in golang. This is my third project using golang.😎😎😎


## Frontend

The frontend is written in ReactJS. React is a popular library for creating frontend. I used it as it requires less code to write.😂😂😂


If you like my project **Please Give this repo star**. Thank you.!
